## Stock Prediction for Financial Corporates in Australia

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting stock prices for Australian companies. 

The notebook explores stock market trends, applies data preprocessing techniques, and implements machine learning models to predict future stock prices. 

The project is designed to aid in understanding stock movements and decision-making for investors.

## Features

- **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: 
  - Importing and preparing stock price data.
  - Handling missing values, normalizing datasets, and feature engineering.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Visualization of stock price trends.
  - Identification of patterns and anomalies.

- **Prediction Models**:
  - Implementation of deep learning models for time-series predictions.
  - Implementation of prophet models for future forecasts

- **Result Visualization**:
  - Graphical representation of predicted versus actual prices.
  - Comparation between actual predicted prices and return on investment (ROI) in the forecasted period
  - Insights derived from the models.

### Findings

#### Deep Learning:
The results retrieved from the analysis indicate that in the short-term (120-day) investment perspective:
 - Westpac Banking Corporation (WBC) and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) show positive ROI of approximately 30% for both
 - Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) and National Australia Bank (NAB) show negative ROI of about -20% and -10% respectively

#### Prophet:
The results retrieved from the analysis indicate that in the short-term (120-day) investment perspective:
 - While the values are higher than other corporates, Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) indicates the lowest ROI of only about 6%
 - National Australia Bank (NAB) and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) shows similar ROI of approximately 8%
 - Westpac Banking Corporation (WBC) demonstrates highest ROI of about 12.5%
